# Hi, I'm Shaddy

Welcome to **shaddyhub** — where curiosity meets code, and data tells a story.

## Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate  
I’m really proud of this one. Not just because it was challenging (and it was), but because I earned it while juggling work, travel, and life.  
From late-night study sessions to reviewing dashboards in airport lounges — this was a grind.  
But I stuck with it, and it reignited my love for learning and deepened my curiosity about data.

### What I Gained:
- Advanced data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis
- A deeper curiosity for how data powers everything
- A renewed passion for learning and pushing past limits

## What I’m About
- Exploring insights through clean, impactful data storytelling
- Building skills in analytics, automation, and decision science
- Staying curious, always growing
